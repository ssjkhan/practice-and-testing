# Tutorials and Testing Collection Global

I'm big on always learning and curious about new tech.

But, learning new tools and tech can often be a winding, messy road of multiple
resources, documentation, mistakes, trial and error, and then finally a success.
Rather than clutter my profile with 100 messy repos to showcase my growth, this
is a single repo that contains all the happy little accidents that I make on my
way to becoming a great software developer.
